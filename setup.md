# Software
For this course you will need the UNIX shell, plus [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/) or
[DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

If you are running Linux, you may already have SQLite3 installed, otherwise you
should be able to get it from your package manager (on Debian/Ubuntu, you can
use the command `apt install sqlite3`).

# Files
Please download the database we'll be using: [survey.db]({{ page.root }}/files/survey.db)
